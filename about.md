Welcome to my webpage! I am a Master's student at [Florida Institute of Technology](https://www.fit.edu/) studying [Computer Engineering](https://www.fit.edu/engineering-and-science/academics-and-learning/computer-engineering-and-sciences/). Some of my current professional interests are machine learning, signal processing, speech recognition, and computer systems.

I created this webpage to document my current research. Feel free to reach out with any questions or comments.
